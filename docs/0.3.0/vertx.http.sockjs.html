SockJS enables browsers to communicate with the server using a
simple WebSocket-like api for sending and receiving messages. Under
the bonnet SockJS chooses to use one of several protocols depending
on browser capabilities and what appears to be working across the
network.

Available protocols include:

* WebSockets
* xhr-polling
* xhr-streaming
* json-polling
* event-source
* html-file

This means it should just work irrespective of what browser
is being used, and whether there are nasty things like proxies and
load balancers between the client and the server.

For more detailed information on SockJS, see their website.

On the server side, you interact using instances of SockJSSocket -
this allows you to send data to the client or receive data via
vertx.stream/on-data.

You can register multiple applications with the same SockJSServer,
each using different path prefixes, each application will have its
own handler, and configuration.</pre><div class="public " id="var-bridge"><h3>bridge</h3><div class="usage"><code>(bridge server config inbound-permitted outbound-permitted)</code><code>(bridge server config inbound-permitted outbound-permitted auth-timeout)</code><code>(bridge server config inbound-permitted outbound-permitted auth-timeout auth-address)</code></div><pre class="doc">Install an app which bridges the SockJS server to the event bus.
config is a map of configuration options (see install-app).
inbound-permitted and outbound-permitted are lists of JSON objects
which define permitted matches for inbound (client-&gt;server) and
outbound (server-&gt;client) traffic, respectively. See the &quot;Securing
the Bridge&quot; section of the manual for the proper usage of these
options. auth-timeout specifies the amount of time (in ms) an
authorisation will be cached in the bridge (defaults to 5 minutes).
auth-address specifies the address of the auth manager (defaults to
'vertx.basicauthmanager.authorise')</pre><div class="src-link"><a href="https://github.com/vert-x/mod-lang-clojure/tree/master/src/main/clojure/vertx/http/sockjs.clj#L108">Source</a></div></div><div class="public " id="var-install-app"><h3>install-app</h3><div class="usage"><code>(install-app server config handler)</code></div><pre class="doc">Installs a SockJS application.
When the server receives a SockJS request that matches the
configured :prefix, it creates an instance of SockJSSocket and
passes it to the connect handler. handler can either be a
single-arity fn or a Handler instance that will be passed the
socket. Returns the server instance.

config can contain the following values:

* :prefix - A url prefix for the application. All http requests whose
  paths begins with selected prefix will be handled by the
  application. This property is mandatory.
* :insert_JSESSIONID - Some hosting providers enable sticky sessions
  only to requests that have JSESSIONID cookie set. This setting
  controls if the server should set this cookie to a dummy value. By
  default setting JSESSIONID cookie is enabled. More sophisticated
  behaviour can be achieved by supplying a function.
* :session_timeout - The server sends a close event when a client
  receiving connection have not been seen for a while. This delay is
  configured by this setting. By default the close event will be
  emitted when a receiving connection wasn't seen for 5 seconds.
* :heartbeat_period - In order to keep proxies and load balancers
  from closing long running http requests we need to pretend that the
  connecion is active and send a heartbeat packet once in a
  while. This setting controlls how often this is done. By default a
  heartbeat packet is sent every 5 seconds.
* :max_bytes_streaming - Most streaming transports save responses on
  the client side and don't free memory used by delivered
  messages. Such transports need to be garbage-collected once in a
  while. :max_bytes_streaming sets a minimum number of bytes that can
  be send over a single http streaming request before it will be
  closed. After that client needs to open new request. Setting this
  value to one effectively disables streaming and will make streaming
  transports to behave like polling transports. The default value is
  128K.
* :library_url - Transports which don't support cross-domain
  communication natively ('eventsource' to name one) use an iframe
  trick. A simple page is served from the SockJS server (using its
  foreign domain) and is placed in an invisible iframe. Code run from
  this iframe doesn't need to worry about cross-domain issues, as it's
  being run from domain local to the SockJS server. This iframe also
  does need to load SockJS javascript client library, and this option
  lets you specify its url (if you're unsure, point it to the latest
  minified SockJS client release, this is the default). The default
  value is http://cdn.sockjs.org/sockjs-0.3.4.min.js</pre><div class="src-link"><a href="https://github.com/vert-x/mod-lang-clojure/tree/master/src/main/clojure/vertx/http/sockjs.clj#L56">Source</a></div></div><div class="public " id="var-set-hooks"><h3>set-hooks</h3><div class="usage"><code>(set-hooks server &amp; {:as hooks})</code></div><pre class="doc">Registers functions to be called when certain events occur on an event bus bridge.
 Takes the following kwargs:

 :closed        Called when the socket has been closed. The fn will be
                passed the SockJSSocket
 :send          Called when the clent is sends data. The fn will be
                passed SockJSSocket, the message, and the eventbus
                address. The fn must return truthy for the send to be
                allowed.
 :publish       Called when the clent is publishes data. The fn will be
                passed SockJSSocket, the message, and the eventbus
                address. The fn must return truthy for the publish to be
                allowed.
 :pre-register  Called before a client handler registration is processed.
                The fn will be passed the SockJSSocket and the address.
                The fn must return truthy for the registration to be
                allowed.
 :post-register Called after a client handler registration is processed.
                The fn will be passed the SockJSSocket and the address.
 :unregister    Called before a client handler unregistration is processed.
                The fn will be passed the SockJSSocket and the address.
                The fn must return truthy for the unregistration to be
                allowed.

Returns the server. Calling set-hooks more than once will overwrite
the hooks set previously.</pre><div class="src-link"><a href="https://github.com/vert-x/mod-lang-clojure/tree/master/src/main/clojure/vertx/http/sockjs.clj#L157">Source</a></div></div><div class="public " id="var-sockjs-server"><h3>sockjs-server</h3><div class="usage"><code>(sockjs-server http-server)</code></div><pre class="doc">Create a SockJS server that wraps an HTTP server.
